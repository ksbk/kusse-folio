## [1.1.1] — 2026-04-18

### Fixed

- Removed duplicate `Optional modules` fieldset in `SiteSettingsAdmin` that
  caused a Django system-check error (`admin.E012`) on startup.

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-18

### Added

- **Blog / writing surface:** `apps/blog` introduces `Post` model with
  published/draft lifecycle. Writing list and detail views, admin, URL
  routing, sitemap, and nav/footer links all included. The surface ships
  suppressed (no posts seeded) so buyers who don't need a blog see nothing
  until they publish.
- **Social links:** `SocialLink` model — ordered, platform-typed links managed
  in admin and rendered in the footer. Zero hardcoded social URLs remain.
- **Tag-based project taxonomy:** `Project` records now carry `tags` (a
  TextField with one tag per line). The project list filter uses `?tag=`
  rather than the legacy `?category=` parameter. The migration canonicalises
  existing category values to the new tag vocabulary. `?category=` is silently
  remapped at the view layer for backwards compatibility.

### Changed

- **`AboutProfile` fields renamed:** All architecture-specific field names
  replaced with generic professional-portfolio equivalents
  (`practice_summary` → `bio_summary`, `project_leadership` → `work_approach`,
  etc.). Admin labels and help text updated throughout.
- **Project enquiry logic decoupled:** Enquiry-type mapping removed from
  `Project` model. `apps/core/enquiry_types.py` is now the single source of
  truth for all enquiry vocabulary.

### Removed

- **`apps/services` surface:** Service listing app removed entirely — models,
  views, templates, admin, migrations, CSS, URL config, e2e tests, and fixtures
  all deleted. Nav, footer, sitemap, and all cross-references updated.
- **`services_meta_description` field:** Removed from `SiteSettings` model
  (migration 0014). Admin fieldset and docs updated.

### Cleaned

- **Admin language:** Architecture- and practice-era wording replaced with
  portfolio-neutral equivalents throughout `apps/site` admin labels, help text,
  and demo constants (`practice` → `studio`, `years in practice` →
  `years of experience`, `Demo Architecture Studio` → `Demo Portfolio Studio`,
  `hello@demo-architecture.example` → `hello@demo-portfolio.example`).
- **Demo seed content:** `seed_demo` and `check_content_readiness` constants
  updated — all architecture-specific copy replaced with discipline-neutral
  portfolio text.

### Internal

- **Migration 0015 — `SiteSettings` help text:** Auto-generated migration for
  updated `help_text` values on `hero_compact`, `hero_label`, `nav_name`,
  `site_name`, and `tagline`.
- **`apps.site` app-label alias documented:** `apps.site` carries
  `label = "core"` because its migrations pre-date the app rename.
  `apps.core` uses `label = "core_runtime"` to avoid collision. Documented in
  `docs/DECISION_LOG.md` as `DL-016` so future migration dependencies use the
  correct label.

---

## [1.0.2] — 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- **Onboarding docs — secret key command:** All five buyer-facing files (`SETUP.md`, `DEMO.md`,
  `README.md`, `.env.example`, `docs/recovery-runbook.md`) instructed buyers to run
  `python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; ..."`. This
  command fails with `ModuleNotFoundError` on any machine where Django is not globally
  installed — the common state after `uv sync`. All occurrences corrected to
  `uv run python -c "..."`, consistent with every other command in these files.
- **Onboarding docs — `seed_demo` framing:** README.md Step 5 labelled `seed_demo` as
  "optional". Without it the site renders blank on first load. Label changed to
  "recommended for first run" with an explicit clarification that skipping it leaves the
  site mostly blank.
- **Onboarding docs — `check_content_readiness` after seed:** SETUP.md Phase 1 gave no
  indication that running `make check-content` immediately after `seed_demo` would show
  nine blockers — all expected, as the starter content is intentionally placeholder.
  A note added making this behaviour explicit and directing buyers to complete Phases 2–6
  before running the check.

### Notes

- No runtime code changes.
- No migration changes.
- Runtime/application code is unchanged; only onboarding docs and release metadata were updated.
- Fresh-install drill (`clone → uv sync → .env → migrate → seed_demo → runserver`)
  confirmed all routes return HTTP 200 with no errors on a clean machine.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-03-24

### Fixed

- **Content resilience — home page:** Trust section now hidden when no trust data is populated (`experience_years`, `project_count`, active services, location all blank). `project_count` stat item individually guarded so a count of zero does not render a blank stat.
- **Content resilience — footer:** Contact column (`email`, social links) is suppressed entirely when every contact field is blank, preventing an empty column in the footer grid.
- **Content resilience — `site_name` blank:** Six public-facing references to `site_name` now fall back to `"Studio Name"` via `|default` so the site is never visibly broken when the field is empty. Admin warns at save-time when `site_name` is blank.
- **Project detail — no cover image:** Projects without a cover image now render correctly. The hero uses a dark surface, compact height matching `page-hero--short` rhythm, and white text — replacing the previous state where white text appeared on a white background.
- **CSS — contact page (769–960 px):** Contact grid gap reduced from `var(--space-xl)` (7 rem) to `var(--space-lg)` (4 rem) inside the `≤960px` media query. At this range the sidebar narrows to 260 px; the original gap left form fields only ~160 px wide on tablet-portrait viewports.
- **CSS — page hero narrow-phone padding:** About and Services pages use the full `.page-hero` variant whose top-padding (`11.5 rem`) consumed ~33 % of the viewport on 320 px screens. A `≤480px` rule now matches `.page-hero--short` rhythm (`8.5 rem` top) at very small widths.

### Changed

- **Nav mobile overlay:** Link group optical centering adjusted (`padding-block-start: 3 rem`) so the menu items sit at ~48 % of the visible dark area rather than appearing low.

### Hardened (release lock pass — 2026-04-12)

- **Brand logic extracted:** `apps/core/brand.py` is now the single source of truth for `compute_monogram()`, `nav_needs_monogram()`, and `NAV_TEXT_MAX_CHARS`/`NAV_TEXT_MAX_WORDS`. Template tags, admin, and management commands all import from here rather than duplicating the logic.
- **Enquiry vocabulary consolidated:** `apps/core/enquiry_types.py` centralises `PROJECT_TYPE_CHOICES`, `LEGACY_PROJECT_TYPE_MAP`, `SERVICE_SLUG_TO_ENQUIRY_TYPE`, and `PROJECT_CATEGORY_TO_ENQUIRY_TYPE`. Previous duplicates in `contact/forms.py`, `contact/views.py`, `services/models.py`, and `projects/models.py` removed.
- **Duplicate system check ID fixed:** Non-HTTPS CSRF origins check was `core.W002` (duplicate of the empty-CSRF check). Renamed to `core.W007`.
- **Model help_text additions:** `SiteSettings.nav_name` (migration 0010), `SiteSettings.address` (0011), and `Testimonial.project` (projects 0004) now carry help_text clarifying their template-product context to buyers.
- **Version consistency:** Version string aligned to `1.0.1` across `pyproject.toml`, `LICENSE.md`, and `uv.lock`.
- **Static file header residue removed:** Personal name references removed from comment headers in `static/css/main.css`, `static/js/main.js`, `static/js/header.js`.
- **`make check-reqs` fixed:** `uv export` errors are no longer silenced; failures surface cleanly.
- **URLField deprecation warning suppressed:** `RemovedInDjango60Warning` for URLField default scheme filtered via `filterwarnings` in `pyproject.toml` rather than via the deprecated transitional setting.
- **`make check-content` reclassified:** Moved from the CI-safe automated gate to an explicit buyer pre-launch gate in `docs/qa/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`. The command requires a populated database and is not CI-safe.
- **Test coverage closed:** View tests added for H-07 (hero placeholder background) and N-01 (logo override suppresses text/monogram). N-06 (transparent home state) signed off via CSS review. G-10 (horizontal overflow) documented as known debt requiring browser render.
- **Privacy policy wording:** Clarified that analytics/error-monitoring services are optional and buyer-enabled.
- **Module docstrings:** "Jeannote" product-name residue replaced with neutral "template repo" language throughout `apps/*/` and `docs/`.

### Known debt — carried forward explicitly

- **G-10 (horizontal overflow):** No automated assertion possible without a browser render viewport. Carry to buyer QA.
- **Branded 404 smoke path:** Dev-server smoke (`DEBUG=True`) cannot prove the custom 404 template. Requires a prod-like instance with `DEBUG=False`.
- **Buyer pre-launch gates:** `make check-content`, `make check-deploy`, and `make smoke-prod` are buyer responsibilities against their customized deployment database; they are outside the template release scope.
