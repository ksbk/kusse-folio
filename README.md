## What this is

A Django template for technical professionals who want a content-managed
portfolio site — not a generic website builder, not a theme on top of a CMS, but a
properly engineered Django application built specifically for this domain.

Kusse Folio is an opinionated professional portfolio template, not a no-code site builder.
Its core public content is managed through Django admin, but launch-critical delivery and
media behavior still require environment configuration, and some visible copy and
structural surfaces still require code edits.

You own the code outright. That means you can customize anything, but not everything is
currently buyer-editable without touching code or deployment settings.

## Customization Truth

- `admin-managed`: brand basics, homepage closing copy, About content, services, projects,
  project media, per-page SEO descriptions, and GA4 measurement ID.
- `env/config-managed — required for launch`: contact delivery, SMTP settings, production
  media storage, and standard production Django settings.
- `env/config-managed — optional integration`: infrastructure tooling such as Sentry.
- `code-only (simple editorial change)`: some CTA labels, page-hero copy, privacy copy,
  footer legal text, and other fixed editorial strings.
- `code-only (behavior-coupled / risky)`: contact form structure, metadata selection
  logic, service slug mapping, and other logic-tied surfaces.
- `intentionally opinionated`: core navigation, public taxonomy, route structure, and the
  design system.

The canonical source of truth is [docs/admin/CUSTOMIZATION.md](docs/admin/CUSTOMIZATION.md).

---

## Who it's for

- Developers, designers, researchers, and consultants
- Technical professionals establishing or refreshing their public presence
- Professionals replacing a dated or off-brand site
- Agencies building portfolio sites for technical clients
- Buyers who want an opinionated professional portfolio template with a strong admin
  content model, not a drag-and-drop or fully no-code builder

Not a good fit if you need multi-tenant, e-commerce, or blog publishing — this is a
focused tool for a specific purpose.

---

## Launch-Critical Configuration

Before launch, plan for more than admin content entry. Kusse Folio requires environment and
deployment configuration for:

- contact-form delivery (`CONTACT_EMAIL`, SMTP backend, sender settings)
- production media storage for uploaded images
- production Django settings such as `DATABASE_URL`, `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, and
  `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`

Sentry and similar tooling are optional integrations, not launch blockers.

## What Still Requires Code

Some buyer-visible surfaces are not yet `admin-managed`:

- nav labels and footer nav labels
- project taxonomy and filter behavior
- contact form structure and dropdown choices
- some CTA labels and editorial strings across home, services, projects, contact, and privacy
- share-image precedence and metadata logic

See [docs/admin/CUSTOMIZATION.md](docs/admin/CUSTOMIZATION.md) for the detailed matrix.

> **Common assumptions to avoid**
>
> - Nav labels and routes are not `admin-managed`.
> - Project categories are fixed in code.
> - Contact form structure and dropdown choices are code-defined.
> - Some CTA and editorial strings still require template edits.
> - Production media and contact delivery require config, not admin content.

## Repo architecture

This repo separates reusable Django apps from repo-level composition.
Reusable shell and domain apps live under `apps/`; shared project config
and page composition live outside `apps/` so domain concerns do not leak
into the cross-cutting layers.

| Path | Ownership |
| --- | --- |
| `config/` | Django project package: settings split, root URLs, ASGI/WSGI. |
| `apps/core/` | Cross-cutting Django glue only: system checks, context processor, templatetags, and other tiny shared helpers. |
| `apps/site/` | Site-wide content/config/admin behavior: `SiteSettings`, `AboutProfile`, readiness rules, and seed/readiness commands. This app keeps the historical Django app label `core` for migration continuity. |
| `apps/pages/` | Public page composition for Home, About, and Privacy, plus page-scoped CSS. Keep it thin. |
| `apps/projects/` | Reusable portfolio / case-study domain. Owns its templates and CSS. |
| `apps/services/` | Reusable services domain and service-specific enquiry context. Owns its templates and CSS. |
| `apps/contact/` | Reusable enquiry flow, persistence, and delivery handling. Owns its templates and CSS. |
| `templates/` | Repo-level shared shell and global chrome: `base.html`, shared nav/footer, error templates, and `robots.txt`. |
| `static/` | Repo-level shared shell assets. Shared CSS stays under `static/css/` with shallow `base/`, `components/`, and `utilities/` grouping plus one `main.css` entrypoint. |
| `tests/` | Repo-level test suite organised by domain and test layer. |
| `docs/` | Repo-level implementation, QA, and admin documentation system. |
| `scripts/` | Operational helpers and local audit scripts. Treat durable scripts differently from ad hoc audits; do not assume everything here is a reusable platform tool. |

### Structural rules

- Add a new Django app only when a real content/workflow domain needs one.
- Reusable/domain apps own their templates and route-specific static assets. The shared shell stays repo-level in `templates/` and `static/`.
- `apps/core` stays small: checks, context processors, templatetags, and tiny shared glue only.
- Site-wide content/config/admin behavior belongs in `apps/site/`, not in `apps/core`.
- Page composition belongs in `apps/pages/`, not in `apps/site/`.
- Do not make a surface reusable unless more than one real project proves the boundary is stable.
- If a new feature is global only because it is configured once, that still does **not** automatically make `apps/core` the right home; use `apps/site` for site-wide content/config or create a new domain app if it owns a real workflow or content model.

---

## Local setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (`brew install uv` or see docs)

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for the full phase-by-phase guide from first run to live site, including environment configuration, admin content phases, email setup, and production deployment.

---

## Run locally with Docker

An alternative to the `uv` setup above. Useful for reproducible local start-up
across macOS and Windows without installing Python or uv on the host.

### Docker requirements

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (macOS / Windows)
  or Docker Engine + Compose plugin (Linux)

### 1. Copy the env file — **required before first run**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then open `.env` and set `SECRET_KEY`. Everything else works as-is for local dev.
`docker compose up` will fail immediately if `.env` does not exist.

### 2. Build and start

```bash
docker compose up --build
# or: make docker-up
```

The container runs `python manage.py migrate --noinput` before the dev server
starts, so the database is always up to date on each run.

- Site: **<http://localhost:8000>**
- Admin: **<http://localhost:8000/admin>**

### 3. Stop

```bash
docker compose down
# or: make docker-down
```

### 4. Useful one-off commands

```bash
# Open a shell inside the running container
docker compose exec web sh

# Run migrations manually (also runs automatically on `up`)
docker compose exec web python manage.py migrate

# Create an admin user
docker compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser

# Seed demo content
docker compose exec web python manage.py seed_demo

# Run the test suite
docker compose exec web pytest
# or: make docker-test

# Run a single test file
docker compose exec web pytest tests/projects/test_views.py
```

### Notes

- The repo is bind-mounted into the container at `/app`. Code changes on the
  host are reflected immediately — Django's auto-reloader works as normal.
- The SQLite database (`db.sqlite3`) is also on the bind mount, so data
  persists between `docker compose down / up` cycles.
- The virtualenv lives at `/opt/venv` inside the image, outside the bind
  mount, so it is never shadowed when you start the container.
- This setup uses `config.settings.dev` (the default). It is **not** wired
  to Railway or any production config.
- **Production is not served from this Dockerfile.** Railway builds directly
  from `Procfile` + `railway.toml` via nixpacks — the `Dockerfile` and
  `compose.yml` are never used in that environment.
- If you prefer the `uv` workflow, see the [Local setup](#local-setup) section
  above. Both approaches are fully supported.

## Dependency management

| File | Role | Edit by hand? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pyproject.toml` | Authoring source — declares all runtime and dev dependencies | **Yes** |
| `uv.lock` | Full locked dependency graph for reproducible installs | No |
| `requirements.txt` | Generated export for Railway/nixpacks deployment | **No** — run `make reqs` |

Workflow when adding or changing a dependency:

```bash
# 1. Edit pyproject.toml (add/remove from [project].dependencies or [dependency-groups].dev)
# 2. Sync the lockfile and virtualenv
uv sync --group dev
# 3. Regenerate the deployment export
make reqs
# 4. Commit all three files together
git add pyproject.toml uv.lock requirements.txt
```

CI enforces that `requirements.txt` matches the declared dependencies (`make check-reqs`).
If you see a CI failure on that step, run `make reqs` and commit the result.

---

## Settings structure

```text
config/settings/
├── base.py     # Shared settings for all environments
├── dev.py      # Development overrides (DEBUG=True, console email)
└── prod.py     # Production hardening (HSTS, SSL redirect, secure cookies)
```

`manage.py` defaults to `config.settings.dev`. Set `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`
in your environment or deployment config to switch to `config.settings.prod`.

---

## Code quality

### Lint and format

```bash
uv run ruff check .          # lint
uv run ruff check . --fix    # lint with auto-fix
uv run ruff format .         # format
```

### Type checking

```bash
uv run mypy .
```

### One-command health gate

```bash
make health
```

This runs the standard repo guardrails in one pass:

- `ruff`
- `mypy`
- `pytest`
- `python manage.py check`
- `python manage.py makemigrations --check --dry-run`
- `make check-reqs`

### Tests

Tests live in `tests/` organised by domain, mirroring the `apps/` layout:

```text
tests/
  conftest.py          # shared fixtures (site_settings, project, service)
  core/
    test_checks.py     # core.W001 system check (email backend guard)
    test_templatetags.py  # first_paragraph filter
    test_views.py      # admin, sitemap, robots.txt
  contact/
    test_admin.py      # no-add permission for inquiries
    test_forms.py      # form validation, POST, email-failure resilience
    test_models.py     # ContactInquiry default status
    test_views.py      # contact GET, success page, query param prefill
  e2e/
    conftest.py        # live server + browser fixtures
    test_contact.py    # contact submit/success flow
    test_homepage.py   # homepage smoke
    test_navigation.py # mobile navigation
    test_projects.py   # project list usability
    test_services.py   # services seeded-content flow
  pages/
    test_views.py      # home/about pages and featured-project exclusion
  projects/
    test_admin.py      # admin thumbnail helpers
    test_models.py     # Project, ProjectImage, Testimonial
    test_views.py      # list, detail, context, query count, og_image fallback
  services/
    test_models.py     # Service str, slug, deliverables
    test_views.py      # services page
  site/
    test_admin.py      # SiteSettings / AboutProfile admin guardrails
    test_management_commands.py  # launch-readiness and seed commands
    test_models.py     # SiteSettings and AboutProfile singletons
```

```bash
uv run pytest                       # fast pytest suite (excludes e2e by default)
uv run pytest -x                    # stop on first failure
uv run pytest tests/projects/       # one domain
uv run pytest tests/contact/test_forms.py  # one file
uv run playwright install chromium  # install the browser once locally
uv run pytest tests/e2e --override-ini="addopts=-v --tb=short" -m e2e --browser chromium
```

`uv run pytest` excludes browser tests by default — use `make test-e2e` for the Playwright suite. CI runs both.

### Coverage

```bash
make coverage
# or: uv run pytest --cov --cov-report=term-missing
```

Run `make coverage` to see the current figure.
Coverage is also reported in CI on every push.

### pre-commit hooks

Install hooks into your local git repo (one-time):

```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```

Hooks run automatically on `git commit`. To run manually against all files:

```bash
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

Hooks configured:

- `trailing-whitespace`, `end-of-file-fixer`, `check-yaml`, `check-toml`
- `check-merge-conflict`, `check-added-large-files`, `debug-statements`
- `no-commit-to-branch` (protects `main`)
- `ruff check` + `ruff-format`

### Makefile shortcuts

```bash
# Development
make run           # start dev server
make migrate       # apply migrations
make migrations    # create new migrations
make superuser     # create admin user interactively
make seed          # seed demo content
make collectstatic # collect static files
make tree          # print project tree

# Code quality
make lint          # ruff check (no fix)
make fmt           # ruff check --fix + ruff format
make typecheck     # mypy
make test          # pytest (excludes e2e by default)
make test-e2e      # Playwright browser tests in Chromium
make health        # ruff + mypy + pytest + Django checks + dep drift
make coverage      # pytest --cov --cov-report=term-missing
make check-deploy  # manage.py check --deploy (prod settings)
make smoke         # smoke-check a running instance via SMOKE_BASE_URL
make check-reqs   # verify requirements.txt matches pyproject.toml
make reqs         # regenerate requirements.txt after dep changes

# Clean
make clean-db      # delete db.sqlite3 (prompts for confirmation)
make clean-media   # delete media/ uploads (prompts for confirmation)
make clean-all     # everything (prompts for confirmation)
```

## Management commands

Six custom commands handle content bootstrap, media import, and readiness checking.

| Command | Use for | Safe on production | Idempotent | Key flags |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `seed_demo` | Generic starter content for new installs | Yes | Yes (`get_or_create`) | — |
| `seed_about` | `AboutProfile` skeleton | Yes | Yes — skips non-blank fields | `--force` to overwrite existing |
| `seed_services` | `Service` records | Yes | Yes — skips non-blank fields | `--reset` deletes and reinitialises all |
| `bootstrap_project` | Create one project from local files | Yes | No — creates a new record each run | **`--dry-run` required first** |
| `import_project_images` | Attach images to an existing project | Yes | Yes — deduplicates by filename | **`--dry-run` required first** |
| `check_content_readiness` | Pre-launch content audit | Yes | Yes (read-only) | — |

### Safe production bootstrap order

1. `migrate` + `createsuperuser`
2. `seed_demo` — loads starter/demo content so the site renders on first visit
3. Log in to `/admin/` and replace starter copy with your real content
4. `seed_about` — optional; fills only blank `AboutProfile` fields if you prefer incremental setup
5. `bootstrap_project --dry-run …` then live run for each new project
6. `import_project_images --dry-run …` then live run to attach images

> `seed_demo` is idempotent and loads the shipped starter/demo dataset — it is safe to
> run on a fresh production database to get the site rendering immediately.
> `check_content_readiness` will continue to flag that demo content until you replace it.
> It will update existing records if re-run, so avoid running it after you have replaced
> starter/demo content with your own real content.

## Template layout

Templates are split across two locations with distinct ownership:

| Location | Owns | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `templates/` | Repo level | Shared shell and global chrome — `base.html`, nav, footer, errors, `robots.txt` |
| `static/` | Repo level | Shared shell CSS, JS, and shared images |
| `apps/pages/templates/pages/` | `pages` app | Home, About, and Privacy composition templates |
| `apps/projects/templates/projects/` | `projects` app | Project list and detail |
| `apps/contact/templates/contact/` | `contact` app | Contact form and success page |
| `apps/services/templates/services/` | `services` app | Services listing |

Django's `APP_DIRS=True` loader finds app-level templates automatically. The shared shell stays repo-level, `apps/pages` owns page composition, and domain apps own their route templates.

---

## Data models

| Model | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `SiteSettings` | Global metadata: name, tagline, contact, social links, SEO, analytics |
| `AboutProfile` | About page: identity, narrative, professional profile, optional portrait, optional CV file |
| `Service` | Service offering with description, deliverables, and ordering |
| `Project` | Portfolio project with full story structure and SEO fields |
| `ProjectImage` | Gallery images per project with type classification |
| `Testimonial` | Client quotes with optional project association |
| `ContactInquiry` | Submitted contact forms — managed entirely in admin |

`SiteSettings` and `AboutProfile` are **singleton models** (only one row each).

---

## URL routes

| URL | View | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |

## Environment variables

All configuration is via environment variables (read from `.env` locally,
or injected by your hosting platform in production). See `.env.example` for
the complete annotated list.

| Variable | Required | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SECRET_KEY` | **Yes** | — | Generate with Django's `get_random_secret_key()` |
| `DEBUG` | No | `True` | Always `False` in production |
| `ALLOWED_HOSTS` | **Prod** | `localhost,127.0.0.1` | Comma-separated hostname list |
| `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` | **Prod** | `config.settings.dev` | Set to `config.settings.prod` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | **Prod** | SQLite | `postgres://user:pass@host/db` |
| `EMAIL_BACKEND` | **Prod** | Console backend | Must be SMTP in production ⚠️ |
| `EMAIL_HOST` | If SMTP | — | SMTP hostname |
| `EMAIL_PORT` | If SMTP | `587` | Usually 587 (TLS) or 465 (SSL) |
| `EMAIL_USE_TLS` | If SMTP | — | Set `True` for port 587 |
| `EMAIL_HOST_USER` | If SMTP | — | SMTP login username |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` | If SMTP | — | SMTP login password |
| `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL` | No | = `CONTACT_EMAIL` | "From" address on outgoing mail |
| `CONTACT_EMAIL` | **Prod** | — | Receives contact form notifications |
| `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` | **Prod** | `[]` | Required behind HTTPS reverse proxies |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | Recommended | — | Enables Sentry exception capture in production |
| `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` | No | `production` | Environment name reported to Sentry |
| `SENTRY_RELEASE` | No | — | Release/commit identifier shown on Sentry events |
| `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE` | No | `0.0` | Performance tracing sample rate from `0.0` to `1.0` |
| `SENTRY_SEND_DEFAULT_PII` | No | `False` | Leave off unless you explicitly want request/user PII |

## Production deployment

> **Status:** Railway is the first deployment target. The `Procfile` (gunicorn) and `railway.toml` are committed and ready. The first deploy is manual. Production media is already wired to Cloudinary in `prod.py`, but the required Cloudinary credentials and real SMTP settings must be present in the deployment environment before launch.

### 1. Activate production settings

Set in your hosting platform's environment:

```text
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings.prod
```

This enables `DEBUG=False`, HSTS, SSL redirect, and secure cookies. **Do not deploy without this.**

### 2. Minimum required environment variables

```dotenv
SECRET_KEY=<long-random-string>
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings.prod
ALLOWED_HOSTS=yourdomain.com,www.yourdomain.com
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:5432/dbname
CONTACT_EMAIL=hello@yourdomain.com
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,https://www.yourdomain.com
SENTRY_DSN=https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0
```

### 3. Email — must configure before launch ⚠️

> Without a real email backend, the site owner receives no notification when
> a contact form is submitted. Enquiries are saved to the database but arrive
> silently.

This template intentionally separates:

- the public email shown on the site: `Site Settings.contact_email`
- the inbox that receives contact-form notifications: `CONTACT_EMAIL`
- the sender shown on outgoing emails: `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`

```dotenv
EMAIL_BACKEND=django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
EMAIL_HOST_USER=apikey
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-api-key
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=Your Name <hello@yourdomain.com>
```

Recommended providers: SendGrid, Mailgun, Postmark, Amazon SES.

### 3a. Error visibility — enable before launch

Sentry is now supported in `config.settings.prod` and initializes only when
`SENTRY_DSN` is present. The smallest correct production setup is:

```dotenv
SENTRY_DSN=https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0
SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=production
SENTRY_RELEASE=<git-sha-or-release-name>
```

`SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE` defaults to `0.0`, so this starts with exception
monitoring only. Increase tracing later only if you want performance data.

### 4. Media file persistence — must resolve before uploading real content ⚠️

> On ephemeral platforms (Railway and similar) uploaded files are deleted on
> every deploy. The default local-filesystem storage is not suitable for
> production use. **This must be resolved before any real images are uploaded
> to a live environment.**

This repo already resolves that in production by setting:

```python
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = "cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage"
```

To make uploads durable in production, set these three environment variables:

```dotenv
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
```

If those are missing, admin-managed uploads will fail at runtime. Static files
are a separate concern and continue to be served by Whitenoise.

### 5. Static files

Static files are served by [Whitenoise](https://whitenoise.readthedocs.io) — no CDN required. Run once:

```bash
make collectstatic
```

### 6. First-time deployment steps

```bash
uv run python manage.py migrate
uv run python manage.py createsuperuser
uv run python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
# optional:
uv run python manage.py seed_demo
```

Then log in to `/admin/` to configure Site Settings, upload images, and replace demo content.

### 7. Pre-launch verification

This section is the deploy-reference view of verification commands.
For the ordered buyer launch path, use [SETUP.md](SETUP.md).
For the maintainer release-tag procedure and command truth, use [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md).

```bash
# Repo health gate
make health

# Production security/config audit (should pass cleanly)
make check-deploy

# Smoke-check a running instance after deploy
SMOKE_BASE_URL=https://yourdomain.com make smoke
```

`make check-deploy` now injects dummy-but-valid values for production-only
environment variables so that warnings are real misconfigurations, not noise
from the local shell. If it warns, fix the underlying production setting.

### 8. Deployment checklist

Use the root guides that own these workflows instead of maintaining a second
process checklist here:

- Buyer onboarding and launch path: [SETUP.md](SETUP.md)
- Maintainer release-tag procedure and command truth: [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md)

## Continuous integration

A GitHub Actions workflow ([`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml)) runs on every push and pull request:

| Step | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Lint | `uv run ruff check .` |
| Type check | `uv run mypy .` |
| Tests + coverage | `uv run pytest --cov --cov-report=term-missing` |
| Django system check | `uv run python manage.py check` |
| Migration drift check | `uv run python manage.py makemigrations --check --dry-run` |
| Deploy check | `make check-deploy` |
| Dep drift check | `make check-reqs` |

CI uses `config.settings.dev` (SQLite, console email) with a dummy `SECRET_KEY`. No deployment step is wired — deploys are manual by design until the production media and SMTP configuration is confirmed.
