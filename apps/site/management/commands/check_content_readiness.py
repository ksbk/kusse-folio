Management command: check_content_readiness
-------------------------------------------
Checks that the site has been customised from template defaults and has the
minimum content needed for a public launch.

Exit code 0 — all checks pass.
Exit code 1 — at least one blocking launch issue was reported.

Usage:
    uv run python manage.py check_content_readiness
    # or via Make:
    make check-content

Suitable as a pre-launch gate.  Add to a deploy checklist, not to `make health`
(health is CI-safe; this command requires a populated database).
