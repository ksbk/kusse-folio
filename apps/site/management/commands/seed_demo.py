Management command: python manage.py seed_demo

Seeds a complete set of generic starter content: SiteSettings, AboutProfile,
Services, and placeholder projects so the site renders immediately after setup.

This is your starting point — use it to see a working site, then replace
content with your own via the admin. All copy uses generic placeholders;
nothing is specific to any individual or region.

Idempotent — safe to re-run (uses get_or_create / update, duplicate detection
for cover images and gallery images).

The brief called for a family home that would feel rooted in its place, generous without excess, and quietly contemporary in character.",
        "challenge": "The site presented both an opportunity and a constraint. The slope made conventional construction expensive, but it also offered the possibility of layering the programme vertically — allowing each space to find its own horizon. The challenge was to use this sectional complexity architecturally rather than treating it as a problem to overcome.",
        "concept": "The design concept resolves around a single spine wall that runs parallel to the contours and anchors the building to the hillside. From this wall, a series of platforms step down the slope — living above, sleeping below, landscape everywhere. Each level is connected by a continuous internal stair that also functions as the organisational core of the house.",

The project combines a durable outer shell with a calm internal circulation sequence, giving the building a public identity that feels welcoming rather than ceremonial.",
        "challenge": "The site was highly exposed to wind and shifting weather, and the brief combined different public uses that needed to coexist without the building feeling over-programmed. The project also needed to read clearly from a distance in a sparse waterfront setting.",
        "concept": "The building is organised around a sheltered public threshold and a clear internal route that links the main civic rooms. Rather than relying on formal complexity, the project uses proportion, depth, and daylight to make movement through the building intuitive.",

The brief asked for a building that would serve the neighbourhood as a library, study space, and informal gathering place — one that would feel welcoming even to those who had never entered a library before.",
        "challenge": "Public libraries often fail because they are over-designed as monuments or under-designed as pragmatic sheds. The challenge here was to make a building that was distinct enough to be a destination while remaining genuinely open and non-intimidating — a threshold between the street and a place of quiet.",
        "concept": "The pavilion is organised around a central covered courtyard — an in-between space that is neither inside nor outside — from which all other rooms are reached. The roof structure is a lightweight timber frame that filters light without enclosing it. The building makes no grand gestures; its civic presence comes from its quality of light, material, and the generosity of its threshold.",
