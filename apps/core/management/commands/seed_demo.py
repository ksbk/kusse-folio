Management command: python manage.py seed_demo

Seeds a complete set of generic starter content: SiteSettings, AboutProfile,
Services, and placeholder projects so the site renders immediately after setup.

This is your starting point — use it to see a working site, then replace
content with your own via the admin. All copy uses generic placeholders;
nothing is specific to any individual or region.

Idempotent — safe to re-run (uses get_or_create / update, duplicate detection
for cover images and gallery images).

Optional flag

  --media-dir PATH   Attach demo media from a local folder.

The brief called for a family home that would feel rooted in its place, generous without excess, and quietly contemporary in character.",
        "challenge": "The site presented both an opportunity and a constraint.

The challenge was to use this sectional complexity architecturally rather than treating it as a problem to overcome.",
