Management command: python manage.py seed_demo

Seeds a complete set of generic starter content: SiteSettings, AboutProfile,
Services, and placeholder projects so the site renders immediately after setup.

This is your starting point — use it to see a working site, then replace
content with your own via the admin. All copy uses generic placeholders;
nothing is specific to any individual or region.

Idempotent — safe to re-run (uses get_or_create / update, duplicate detection
for cover images and gallery images).
