        "year": 2023,
        "area": "320 m²",
        "overview": "Set on a steeply sloping site at the edge of a small town, this private house uses the natural fall of the land to organise a sequence of living levels — each with its own relationship to the landscape and light. The brief called for a family home that would feel rooted in its place, generous without excess, and quietly contemporary in character.",
        "challenge": "The site presented both an opportunity and a constraint. The slope made conventional construction expensive, but it also offered the possibility of layering the programme vertically — allowing each space to find its own horizon. The challenge was to use this sectional complexity architecturally rather than treating it as a problem to overcome.",
        "concept": "The design concept resolves around a single spine wall that runs parallel to the contours and anchors the building to the hillside. From this wall, a series of platforms step down the slope — living above, sleeping below, landscape everywhere. Each level is connected by a continuous internal stair that also functions as the organisational core of the house.",

        "overview": "This community library pavilion was commissioned by a local municipality as part of a small civic precinct development. The brief asked for a building that would serve the neighbourhood as a library, study space, and informal gathering place — one that would feel welcoming even to those who had never entered a library before.",
        "challenge": "Public libraries often fail because they are over-designed as monuments or under-designed as pragmatic sheds. The challenge here was to make a building that was distinct enough to be a destination while remaining genuinely open and non-intimidating — a threshold between the street and a place of quiet.",
        "concept": "The pavilion is organised around a central covered courtyard — an in-between space that is neither inside nor outside — from which all other rooms are reached. The roof structure is a lightweight timber frame that filters light without enclosing it. The building makes no grand gestures; its civic presence comes from its quality of light, material, and the generosity of its threshold.",
        "outcome": "The pavilion has become a well-used public space. Usage data from the first year showed significantly higher visitor numbers than comparable libraries in the region. The courtyard has been informally adopted as an after-school gathering space.",

        "challenge": "Years of minor alterations had obscured the apartment's original logic and left it a sequence of poorly proportioned, poorly lit rooms. The challenge was to recover the spatial potential within a fixed building envelope — and to do so on a limited renovation budget.",
        "concept": "The design consolidates circulation to free up living, creates a contained kitchen core that frees the main space entirely, and uses a consistent material language — white plaster, dark-stained timber, exposed concrete — to give the apartment coherence and a sense of deliberateness it had never had.",
        "outcome": "The apartment now reads as a confident, well-proportioned urban dwelling. The living area, which previously felt fragmented, now functions as a single continuous room with direct daylight from two aspects.",
