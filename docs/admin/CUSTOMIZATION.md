# Customization

Kusse Folio is an opinionated professional portfolio template, not a no-code site builder.
This document is the canonical source of truth for what buyers can change in admin, what
requires environment or deployment configuration, what still requires code edits, and
what is intentionally fixed by product choice.

## How To Read This Doc

Use the classification labels exactly as written:

- `admin-managed`: editable in Django admin without changing code or deployment config.
- `env/config-managed — required for launch`: not admin-managed; must be configured in
  the environment or deployment settings before launch.
- `env/config-managed — optional integration`: not admin-managed; optional tooling or
  infrastructure integration that can be added later.
- `code-only (simple editorial change)`: visible copy or assets that currently require a
  code or template edit, but do not meaningfully change application behavior.
- `code-only (behavior-coupled / risky)`: surfaces that are tied to routes, forms,
  taxonomy, metadata selection, or other logic where edits carry higher implementation
  risk.
- `intentionally opinionated`: fixed by product choice. These are not bugs in the docs;
  they are deliberate constraints of the template.

The `recommended action` column means:

- `leave as-is`: current behavior is acceptable for the product as positioned.
- `document clearly`: keep it for now, but make the limitation explicit in buyer-facing docs.
- `move to admin later`: a reasonable later-stage product improvement, but not required to
  tell the truth now.
- `refactor before sale`: current behavior creates too much trust risk to leave vague.
- `keep opinionated`: intentionally fixed unless the product direction changes.

## Hard-Coded Traps

- The site looks more admin-editable than it really is. Nav labels, several CTA labels,
  privacy copy, contact copy, and multiple editorial strings are still template-level.
- Project categories are not seeded demo content. They are fixed product taxonomy.
- Service slugs are not just cosmetic. They affect contact-form prefill behavior.
- The public contact page can look complete while internal contact delivery is still
  unconfigured if `CONTACT_EMAIL` and SMTP settings are missing.
- Homepage hero and some share-image behavior are driven indirectly by project ordering,
  cover images, and fallback logic rather than one explicit “hero image” control.
- About CTA behavior changes based on copy length. Long text does not render the same way
  as short text.

## What Is Intentionally Opinionated

These are deliberate product choices in the current version of Kusse Folio:

- the core information architecture: `Projects`, `About`, `Services`, `Contact`
- the architecture-specific public taxonomy: `Housing`, `Civic`, and `Workplace`
- the overall design system, layout language, and route structure
- CTA destinations that reinforce the primary site flow

If you need those surfaces to behave like a no-code site builder, Kusse Folio is the wrong
product shape in its current form.

## Launch-Critical Config vs Optional Integrations

### `env/config-managed — required for launch`

Before launch, confirm these are configured outside Django admin:

- `CONTACT_EMAIL` and SMTP settings so contact-form submissions actually reach you
- production media storage credentials so uploaded images persist and resolve correctly
- standard production Django settings such as `DATABASE_URL`, `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, and
  `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`

### `env/config-managed — optional integration`

These do not block launch:

- `SENTRY_DSN` and related Sentry settings
- analytics or tracking IDs you choose to add later

## Common Assumptions To Avoid

- Nav labels and routes are not `admin-managed`.
- Project categories are fixed in code.
- Contact form structure and dropdown choices are code-defined.
- Some CTA and editorial strings still require template edits.
- Production media and contact delivery require config, not admin content.
